### Project Description  
A *completely unnecessary* yet *technically over-engineered* app that scans a pappadam photo, detects bubbles, and predicts your mood, fortune, and snack destiny â€” purely based on fried geometry.  

---

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People eat pappadam without ever discovering the *spiritual truths* hidden in its bubbles. This ignorance must end.  

---

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
An AI + AR-powered app that counts every bubble, measures density, estimates oil quality, and gives you a personal fortune â€” because your pappadam knows your future better than your horoscope.
